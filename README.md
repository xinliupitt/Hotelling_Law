2. rest_very_small.pickle: this is a file that include features of restaurants from small-scale view. (Obtained from https://iexit.readme.io/ and https://developer.foursquare.com/)


The code file is:

1. Union_Plot_Regressions.ipynb: this file is the notebook script that generates the regression figures and tables based on the above two datasets. The features in these datasets are also detailedly described in this script.
